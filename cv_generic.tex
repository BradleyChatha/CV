\section{Experience}
\cventry{2017--2020}{Work Experience - Student Developer Aide}{AIM Educational Ltd}{Atherstone}{}
{
    Alongside my status as a student, my capabilities allowed me to work on
    several projects for AIM:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item FarmMaster (C\#, ASP Core, PSQL, SASS, Gulp, Webpack, JS\&TS, EF Core, Vue, GraphQL)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A WIP Website solution used to keep track of and manage livestock.
            \item I was the sole, full-stack developer of this project.
        \end{itemize}
        \item AimCLITool (D, Docker)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A custom CLI tool used to easily manage various needs I have, such as automatic deployment and secrets management.
            \item Built on top of my custom CLI and Dependency Injection frameworks: JCLI (D), and JIOC (D)
        \end{itemize}
        \item PolyMaster (Likely: Same as FarmMaster, but with Arduino/ESP32 added)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The project was in the pre-planning stage, it would've been used to automatically manage AIM's new polytunnel.
            \item Arduinos/ESP32s would have been used to monitor and automate various parts of the polytunnel.
            \item A web interface would have been provided to monitor/interact with the various aspects that PolyMaster could manage.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\section{Blogging}
\cvitem{}
{
    On my personal website (see footer) I host my blog, which currently contains:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A short tutorial series covering the vast metaprogramming power of D, by creating a JSON serialiser.
        \item A tutorial series showing misc. projects where D can let you do complex things easily using metaprogramming.
        \item A changelog for my CLI library - JCLI.
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Contributions \& Projects}
\cvitem{DLang}
{
    I have made several contributions to the D programming language and its community, such as:
    Documentation and additions for Phobos - the standard library, fixes \& additions to public D libraries, and the creation of my blog
    which as stated previously, features D.
}
\cvitem{JCLI}
{
    I currently maintain an open-source library called 'JCLI'. A D library used to help create
    command line interface tooling.
}
\cvitem{JANSI}
{
    I also maintain an ANSI (SGR) library in D which aids in the ability to output and also parse ANSI-encoded text.
}
\cvitem{SdlangSharp}
{
    A C\# library that is accelerated by SIMD intrinsics to quickly parse .sdl files into tokens or a DOM.
